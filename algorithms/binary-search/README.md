# Binary Search

Very known search algorithm that works on top of an ordered list of elements.

Binary Search is faster (O(Log n)) when compared with the simple search (O(n)), and it gets even faster if the size of list increases.

If the element is in the list, the algorithm returns its value, if not, returns nil.
