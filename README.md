# Golang Projects

This is the repo where I keep all my golang projects.

## Algorithms

Even tho I am a Computer Science graduate, some of most known algorithms out there are lost in my mind.

To pratice, I decided to read the book "Grokking Algorithms" (by Aditya Y. Bhargava) and implement the algorithms Aditya mention in the book.

In this package, will you find implementations, problem solving algorithms and more.

## Blockchain

I never played with the web 3.0 world. This is my attempt to do so.
